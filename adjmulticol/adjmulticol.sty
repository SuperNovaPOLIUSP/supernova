%% Since this package is based on the multicol package,
%% Copyright 1989-2005 Frank Mittelbach, the following additional
%% condition is added to the licensing terms.  The term ``multicol''
%% here should be interpreted as ``multicol and/or adjmulticol''
%% package, as appropriate.
%%
%%  In addition to the terms of LPPL any distributed version
%%  (unchanged or modified) of multicol has to keep the statement
%%  about the moral obligation for using multicol. In case of major
%%  changes where this would not be appropriate the author of the
%%  changed version should contact the copyright holder.
%%
%%
%%  Moral obligation for using multicol:
%%  ------------------------------------
%%
%%  Users of multicol who wish to include or use multicol or a modified
%%  version in a proprietary and commercially market product are asked
%%  under certain conditions (see below) for the payment of a license
%%  fee.  The size of this fee is to be determined, in each instance,
%%  by the commercial user, depending on his/her judgment of the value of
%%  multicol for his/her product.
%%
%%
%%  The conditions for this are as follows:
%%
%%   The producer of a proprietary and commercially market product
%%   that involves typesetting using multicol is asked to determine
%%   the value of a license fee for using multicol if
%%
%%   - the product is a document and the producer has decided to
%%     include multicol to typeset (parts of) the document or has
%%     directed the author of the document to include multicol (for
%%     example, by providing a class file to be used by the author)
%%
%%   - the product is a LaTeX class or package that includes multicol
%%
%%
%%   There is no moral obligation in case
%%
%%   - the product is a document but producer has not directed
%%     the author to include multicol (in that case the moral obligation
%%     lies with the author of the document)
%%
%%   - the product does not involve typesetting, e.g., consists, for
%%     example, of distributing multicol and its documentation.
%%
%%   - the product is not proprietary, i.e., is made available as free
%%     software itself (which doesn't prohibit its commercial marketing)
%%
%%   - multicol is used for non-commercial purposes
%%
%%
%% Determinating a license fee might result in a license fee of zero
%% (i.e., no payment) in case a producer has determined that the use
%% of multicol has no enhancing effect on the product. This is a
%% plausible scenario, i.e., in the above two cases the producer is
%% only asked to evaluate the value of multicol for the product
%% not for the payment of a license fee per se (which might or might
%% not follow from this evaluation).
%%
%% The license fee, if any, can be payed either to the LaTeX3 fund
%% (see ltx3info.txt in the base LaTeX distribution) or to the author of
%% the program who can be contacted at
